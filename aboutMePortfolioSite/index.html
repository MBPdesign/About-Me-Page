        <div class="bio"> <p class="subTitle">BIO</p>
            <p>Hi my name is Miranda and I am currently a junior at the University of 
            Massachusetts Dartmouth. I am studying to receive a B.F.A in Graphic Design. 
            I have experience with the multiple programs in the Adobe Creative Suite 
            including: Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, Adobe XD, Dreamweaver, 
            and Lightroom. I have strong communication, creativity, and presentation 
            skills. I am driven, outgoing, determined, and eager to learn.</p>

        <div class="interests"> <p class="subTitle">INTERESTS</p>
            <p>I am interested in multiple areas of design. I enjoy packaging, 
                branding, web development, and advertising. I have always seen 
                myself having a career in corporte identity, but throughout my college 
                experience I have been exposed to more design fields. This has broadened
                my view of what field I want to persue a career in. I am also very 
                interested in the business side of design and how marketing interwines 
                with design.</p>
